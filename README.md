# üßë‚Äçüíª HUMAN AGE PREDICTION (COMPUTER VISION)

## Overview
A deep learning project that estimates a person‚Äôs **age from facial images** using convolutional neural networks and transfer learning.  
This regression task was built to explore how visual features correlate with age, using **ResNet50** for feature extraction and fine-tuning.

**Goal:** Predict human age with low Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  
**Best Model:** üèÜ ResNet50 (MAE ‚âà 6.8 years on validation data)

## Functionality
- Loads and preprocesses face image dataset.  
- Applies data augmentation to improve generalization.  
- Builds and fine-tunes a CNN model using **ResNet50**.  
- Trains the model with MSE loss and tracks **MAE** performance.  
- Evaluates predicted vs. actual ages on validation data.

---

## Key Insights
- **Transfer learning** significantly reduces training time and improves accuracy.  
- Model performs best on age ranges **20‚Äì60**, with slightly higher error for older groups.  
- **Data imbalance** (fewer elderly faces) affects model precision at extreme ages.

## Results
| Model | MAE (Validation) | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Baseline CNN | ~13.2 | High bias, underfitting |
| ResNet50 (Pretrained) | ~6.8 | Excellent generalization |
